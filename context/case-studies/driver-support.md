## Context

<!-- Fill in: What team? What was the Flex app? Who are the drivers? -->


## Problem

78% of drivers abandoned the support flow before resolving their issue. The existing experience was fragmented and static — drivers couldn't find relevant help and escalated to human support unnecessarily.

<!-- Add more: What did the old experience look like? What were the top contact reasons? -->


## Your Role

<!-- Fill in: Were you the sole designer? Who did you partner with? -->


## Process

### Discovery / Research

You did driver ride-alongs and competitive analysis, then created a unified journey map.

<!-- Fill in: What did you learn from the ride-alongs? What surprised you? What did the competitive audit reveal? -->

### Exploration

<!-- Fill in: What design directions did you explore? What did you prototype? -->

### Key Design Decisions

- Context-aware support: surfacing relevant help based on the driver's current state
- AI chat assistant: providing contextual guidance while maintaining safety and customer privacy
- Automated resolution flows for top contact reasons (geofence issues, package status)

<!-- Fill in: Why these decisions over alternatives? What trade-offs? -->


## Solution

Launched across 5 marketplaces. The new experience introduced:
- Context-aware support landing page
- AI-first chat experience
- Automated resolution workflows for top contact reasons

<!-- Add screenshots/mockups of the final experience -->
<!-- Describe the key user flows -->


## Outcome

- $2.7M annualized cost savings
- 15.5% improvement in self-service efficacy
- Abandon rate reduced from 78% to 72.5%
- Launched across 5 global marketplaces

<!-- Add any qualitative signals — user feedback, stakeholder reactions -->


## Reflection

<!-- Fill in: What did you learn? What would you do differently? -->
