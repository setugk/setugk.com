## Context

Set the stage. 2-3 sentences max.
- What team were you on?
- What product or area of the business?
- Who were the users?


## Problem

What wasn't working? Be specific.
- What was the evidence? (metrics, user feedback, stakeholder pain)
- Why did it matter to the business?
- What was the cost of not solving it?


## Your Role

What were you specifically responsible for?
- Who did you partner with? (PM, eng, research, data science)
- What was the team structure?
- Were you leading, contributing, or both?


## Process

This is the meat — show how you think. Break it into phases if helpful.

### Discovery / Research
- What did you do to understand the problem? (interviews, data analysis, ride-alongs, competitive audit)
- What surprised you? What did you learn that changed your direction?

### Exploration
- What options did you consider?
- What trade-offs did you weigh?
- Were there disagreements? How did you resolve them?

### Key Design Decisions
- What were the 2-3 most important calls you made?
- Why did you choose this approach over alternatives?
- This is where your judgment shows — be specific.
