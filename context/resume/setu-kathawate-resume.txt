ABOUT

Product Designer with 8+ years of experience building enterprise tools and platforms from 0 to 1. I combine deep UX foundations with AI-native design to prototype, validate, and ship end-to-end — not just designing tools, but building and publishing them. Currently leading AI integration efforts across my design studio and building agentic experiences that change how people interact with complex data.

EXPERIENCE

Amazon — Sr. UX Designer
Mar 2020 – Present

- Defining the UX vision for an AI-native data intelligence platform — prototyping chat-with-metrics and agentic visualization patterns in rapid 2–3 week sprints, partnering directly with engineering and product to explore how executives query and act on customer behavior data.
- Redesigned Driver Support across 5 marketplaces, reducing abandon rate from 78% to 72.5% by replacing fragmented support with context-aware flows and an AI chat assistant — $2.7M annualized savings and 15.5% improvement in self-service efficacy.
- Convinced director-level leadership to keep the existing design system by researching trade-offs across teams and presenting a clear cost-benefit case — saving months of migration work and preserving team velocity.
- Piloted and scaled the Agile UX process studio-wide, providing the data and feedback loop that enabled UX Ops to roll it out to 50+ practitioners — reducing handoff friction between design, product, and engineering.
- Shaped the design studio's AI tooling strategy by hands-on evaluation of prototyping tools, blocking investment in high-learning-curve options and steering the team toward tools that matched their AI-first workflow.

The Home Depot — Sr. UX Designer
Apr 2018 – Feb 2020

- Designed warehouse management dashboards that improved outbound shipping efficiency by >25% and inbound receiving by >100% — directly reducing operational costs and improving delivery reliability.
- Introduced data-driven design practices to a team with no prior design culture, embedding UX research into the product development cycle and shifting engineering conversations from feature requests to user outcomes.
