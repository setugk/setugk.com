ABOUT

Product Designer with 8+ years of experience building enterprise data platforms and tools from 0 to 1. I define product vision at the intersection of data experience design and AI-powered innovation — prototyping, validating, and shipping end-to-end. Currently leading the UX vision for an AI-native data intelligence platform and driving AI integration across a 45-person design studio.

EXPERIENCE

Amazon — Sr. UX Designer
Mar 2020 – Present

- Currently designing an AI-native data intelligence platform to help executives understand the biggest customer issues and opportunities in minutes through AI-powered 5-why analysis — replacing days of manual work across multiple teams.
- Created an AI-powered work journal to help Amazonians document accomplishments and collaborations more consistently — improving the quality of peer and business review inputs. Currently piloting with beta testers.
- Reduced AI tool onboarding from 2–4 weeks to 15 minutes by creating a pre-configured starter kit — enabling 45 designers to adopt AI-assisted development and saving 160+ hours of cumulative ramp-up time.
- Redesigned Driver Support across 5 global marketplaces, reducing abandon rate from 78% to 72.5% by replacing fragmented support with context-aware flows and an AI chat assistant — $2.7M annualized savings.
- Created an integrated operations platform for 5,000+ managers across 175+ fulfillment centers, unifying tools into a single dashboard to monitor network health and resolve exceptions — resulting in 150M+ additional customer packages shipped on-time.
- Led product strategy for Amazon's early generative AI initiative in fulfillment — replacing complex device interfaces with natural language: ask a question, get an answer, take action.
- Piloted and scaled Agile UX studio-wide, enabling UX Ops to roll it out to 50+ practitioners — reducing handoff friction between design, product, and engineering.
- Guided the studio's AI tooling strategy — identifying high-ROI tools and blocking investment in poor-fit options, accelerating AI adoption across 45 designers.

The Home Depot — Sr. UX Designer
Apr 2018 – Feb 2020

- Designed warehouse management dashboards that improved outbound shipping efficiency by >25% and inbound receiving by >100% — directly reducing operational costs and improving delivery reliability.
