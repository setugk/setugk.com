# Resume Context

## Owner
Setu Kathawate — Product Designer, currently Sr. UX Designer at Amazon (since Mar 2020). Previously Sr. UX Designer at The Home Depot (Apr 2018 – Feb 2020). MS in Human Centered Design and Engineering from University of Washington.

## Positioning
Setu is positioning himself as an AI-ready designer for senior/staff-level roles in 2026. The core narrative:
- A designer who can prototype, validate, and ship end-to-end — no longer limited by the design-to-dev handoff.
- AI is an amplifier of his existing UX instincts, not a separate skill.
- He doesn't just use AI tools — he builds and publishes them (Seafile MCP Server).
- Leading AI integration efforts within his design studio at Amazon.
- The resume should read like a senior/staff designer who operates in ambiguity, defines problems, and influences at the director level.

## Design Decisions
- Dark mode, minimalist, typography-driven layout. No cards, boxes, or unnecessary visual elements.
- Background: #111111, body text: #aaa, headings: #e0e0e0 / #ddd, accent: #e08a5e (warm copper).
- Font: Inter. Simplified type scale: 2.25rem/700 (name), 0.9375rem/400 (body), 0.8125rem/400 (small).
- Emphasis on key metrics uses font-weight 500 and color #ddd (subtle, not loud).
- Hierarchy through font size, weight, and color — not visual containers.
- Thin #1e1e1e divider lines between sections.
- Fade-in animations on scroll, hero fade-in on load.
- text-wrap: pretty and &nbsp; for orphan prevention.
- Print stylesheet included for PDF export (light theme, compact layout).

## Tech Stack

## Open Items
1. Data Intelligence platform bullet needs outcomes — Setu is actively working on this project and will provide impact data when available.
2. Case study page(s) — at least one deep dive (Driver Support or Data Intelligence) would significantly strengthen the portfolio.
3. Home Depot bullets could use more specifics if Setu remembers product/user details.
4. Eventually wants blog/articles and UX case study showcases — may need to migrate to a framework (Astro, Next.js) when that time comes.
